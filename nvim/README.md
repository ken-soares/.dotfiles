# Neovim config

This is the config I use for coding mostly in python but also a bit with rust.
I used Emacs with evil mode previously so I added things that I was used to
like a keybinding for buffer switching (like ctrl+x b in Emacs) and 
control + backspace for deleting by word. 

Since I had little to no experience using lua, I inspired myself of other ppl's
configs (mostly [devaslife](https://github.com/craftzdog)) and tweaked the things
I did not like.
